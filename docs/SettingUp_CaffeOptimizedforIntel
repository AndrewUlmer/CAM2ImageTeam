If you want to install caffe on your access node or local, the steps that you need to follow are:

1. Login to the cluster
2. Create a directory where you want to install caffe. (mkdir <directory name> )
3. you can check that git is installed by the command : git --version 
4. Clone the repository from https://github.com/intel/caffe and NOT the link given in the university guide. git clone  https://github.com/intel/caffe
5. Change directory to the location where the Caffe optimized for Intel architecture repository is cloned
and build the framework to use Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) APIs which provide optimized implementations of convolution, pooling, normalization, and other key DNN operations on Intel Xeon Phi processor x200. After performing the instructions below you will have a binary, named caffe, at ~/caffe/build/tools/ (assuming the repository is cloned to ~/caffe):
Copy Makefile.config.example to Makefile.config using the command:
   cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config

6. Now, to open or edit the new Makefile.config file, you can use vim Makefile.config. 
7. use ‘i’ key for intert mode, esc key to come out of insert mode, :wq to save and exit.
   Add the following lines:
  
   USE_MPI := 1
   CXX := /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2017.1.132/linux/mpi/intel64/bin/mpicxx
   
8. To run use the following command from the university guide:	make -j44
