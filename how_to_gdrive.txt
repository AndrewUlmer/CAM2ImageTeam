How to install and use gdrive
This assumes you're using ubuntu
If you want to follow an example use the folder: "CAM2/Data/images/01 unlabeled data"
For documentation, look at https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive or use ./gdrive help
For useful documentation about how to write queries for search, 
see https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/search-parameters#fn1  

Setup
- Go to: https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive
- Download the appropriate version
- Open folder containing download
- Run "chmod +x gdrive-version"
- Run ./gdrive about
- Go to link they give you
- Accept

Finding the folder you want to upload to
- Open google drive in your browser
- Navigate to the folder you want to upload to
- View the information sidebar
- Note the created date, in my case february 7, 2017
- Open terminal
- Run command "./gdrive list -q "name contains '{upload folder}' and trashed = False""
- Replace {upload folder} with appropriate name.  In my case, "01 unlabeled data"
- Confirm the result it gives you has the same created date
- Write down the Id

Uploading 1 file (not a directory)
- Run command "./gdrive upload -p "{folder Id}" <path>
- Replace {folder Id} with the Id you noted down
- Replace <path> with path to file

Uploading directory
- Run command "./gdrive upload -p "{folder Id}" -r <path>
- Replace {folder Id} with the Id you noted down
- Replace <path> with path to directory
- Note that I haven't tested this, results may vary
